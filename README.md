#### What are the issues will I be addressing on this EDA?
This project analyzed monthly CO₂ data from the Mauna Loa Observatory, offering valuable insights into long-term atmospheric carbon trends and their link to global temperature changes, highlighting the urgent need to address rising emissions.

#### What generally causes this kind of issue?
Earth’s temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving the planet’s system. When incoming energy from the sun is absorbed by the Earth system, Earth warms. When the sun’s energy is reflected back into space, Earth avoids warming. When absorbed energy is released back into space, Earth cools. Many factors, both natural and human, can cause changes in Earth’s energy balance, including:

Variations in the sun’s energy reaching Earth

Changes in the reflectivity of Earth’s atmosphere and surface

Changes in the greenhouse effect, which affects the amount of heat retained by the Earth’s atmosphere

####Why is this relevant and how Climate Change will affect me?
This project explored the underlying causes of global temperature changes by examining factors that disrupt Earth’s energy balance. While natural variations like solar intensity and surface reflectivity contribute to climate fluctuations, the most significant and concerning driver is the enhanced greenhouse effect caused by human activities. Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly CO₂, trap more heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate climate change and restore balance to Earth’s climate system.

The Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4) is the most comprehensive U.S. report to date, providing an in-depth synthesis of climate change impacts, trends, and risks to guide informed decision-making and resilience efforts nationwide.

##Task: In summary, the initial analysis revealed missing values in the dataset—a common issue in real-world data—which were cleaned to ensure accurate insights and reliable model predictions.

##Task: Next, I created a new dataframe with yearly average CO₂ levels and used the Seaborn library to plot a linear trend, helping visualize how atmospheric CO₂ has changed over time.

##As you can see in the plot above, I made sure to mark the year 2030. This was the year that the IPCC reported to the United Nations, that marks the deadline for changing our habits to reduce the levels of CO₂ in the atmosphere before irreversible damage is done. As you can see in January 2030 the predicted level of CO₂ in the atmosphere will be 437.3 (ppm). This is a massive change!

##If it isn’t clear by now that climate change is a real and urgent global issue, it’s time to revisit the facts—because immediate action is essential.
Earth is our home planet and we must take care of it.

##Thank you.
